# Music Theory Peer Assistance Sessions

The Monash MSS is very excited to present our new theory assistance program. Beginning in week 6, these programs aim to supply outside help for all students currently completing ATS1900 and ATS2901, in both the classical and jazz/popular streams. PLEASE NOTE: These programs are strictly NOT to replace official Monash University classes and are simply present to supply an extra resource for students who are members of the Monash Music Student Society.
