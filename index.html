	<h1>A place for the musicians of Monash...</h1>
	<p>The Monash Music Students’ Society is a club established by students of the university’s music faculty, primarily aimed at enhancing cohesion amongst students, facilitating communication between staff and students, providing academic and study support, and holding social events both in and outside of the university. After a year of planning, MMSS was officially inaugurated in May 2015 and, in just a few short months, has over 150 members.
<br /><br />MMSS has a very exciting semester ahead! Upcoming events include tutorials starting in Week 3 for first year music subjects (World Music, Theory and Aural for both jazz and classical streams), study skills seminars, a BBQ, fundraising concert, gig nights and an AXP.
<br /><br />The committee includes: 
<br />Genevieve Trinh (President) 
<br />Daniel Tan (Vice-President)
<br />Emily Domingo (Secretary) 
<br />Arthur Athan (Treasurer)
<br />Hayden Dun (Events Officer)
<br />Jazmine Morris (Education Officer)
<br />Tom Bunnett (Equity Officer)
<br /><br />The Monash MSS eagerly looks forward to its first full semester as an officially inaugurated society!</p>
